##Adobe Connect Guide for Students

In order to remotely attend a lesson, students must go to one of the following urls, as determined by their instructor:

http://fvi.adobeconnect.com/oll  
http://fvi.adobeconnect.com/oll2  
http://fvi.adobeconnect.com/oll3  

Once there, students need to sign on using their first and last name and the password **fvioll**

##Usage Policies for Students

1. Your instructor will enable your microphone by default. Please keep it muted unless you are about to speak.
2. You must be present and responsive. If you fail to engage with class you may be counted absent for the day.
3. The instructor may ask you to share your screen. Please ensure your desktop workspace is suitable for a professional environment.

##Usage Policies for Instructors

1. Enable the microphones for all students unless they consistently fail to manage this privilege effectively.
2. Your lecture should be structured in blocks of 30-60mins of lecturing or guided practice followed by 60-120 minutes of hands on work.
3. During hands-on time, you must periodically ask online students to share their screen with you in order to review their work.
4. Class must be conducted in such a manner that online students can always hear you. Under no circumstances should you mute your microphone while having a conversation in the classroom. The hybrid learning experience must be as close to identical to the in-person classroom experience as possible.
5. Keep your desktop workplace professional.

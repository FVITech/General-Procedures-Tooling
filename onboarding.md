# Online Instructors On-Boarding Checklist

1. Ensure you have completed the general on-boarding procedure.
2. Develop a sample lesson **which is related to the subject matter you teach** for use during your online live training session. Make sure you have supporting materials (such as powerpoint slides, pictures, code samples, etc.). This material will be used during your **Mock Lesson**.
3. Set a two-hour meeting with your program director to go over training for online delivery of instructional material.
4. During your training, you must cover the following items with assistance from your program director:
  1. Access the adobe connect portal through http://fvi.adobeconnect.com
  2. Install the Adobe Connect Plugin on your instructional laptop
  3. Host an online live meeting on your instructional computer
  4. Have your program director join your meeting under the role of a student viewer.
    1. Observe the 2-step process required for a student to log in. This process is also detailed in the [General Procedures and Tooling for Online Instructors and Students](README.md) document
    2. Enable your program director's microphone by right clicking on his/her name
  5. Test various features of Adobe Connect with the help of your program director:
    1. Ensure you and your program director can communicate well through audio, by going to different physical locations and exchanging actual sentences. Audio quality is difficult to gauge without real conversation.
    2. Share your screen with your program director and make sure he/she can read a power point slide on your screen
    3. Open notepad and type a sentence, ensure your program director can read it. You may need to adjust the font size of notepad by clicking format, then font.
    4. Have your program director share his/her screen:
      1. Promote your program director to Host
      2. Ask him/her to share their screen
      3. Ensure that you can see your program director's screen
      4. Demote your program director to remove the meeting host rights
  6. Your program director will go over the general tips for good practice which are outlined in the [General Procedures and Tooling for Online Instructors and Students](README.md) document.
  7. Start your mock lesson:
    1. Draft a brief email and send it to your program director with instructions on how to log on as a student. You may use the pre-written set of instructions within the  [General Procedures and Tooling for Online Instructors and Students](README.md) document.
    2. Your program director will follow the instructions in your email and ensure they are a viable set of directions for students to follow.
    3. Now you are free to start the training session you prepared in advance. You will deliver this session while your program director pretends to be a student and follows along.
    4. You will be evaluated on your ability to follow the Usage Policies for Instructors.
    5. Your program director may request that you complete additional mock lessons in order to cement the learning process and good habits of Online Live Instruction.
5. Set a follow-up meeting with your program director to discuss additional student resources. MA-Online instructors will need a training session on the Evolve platform. Technology Instructors will need a very brief training session on how to access ITPro.TV, TeamTreehouse, Packt Library and the FVI Virtual Private Server for use in teaching.
